Simple Command Line Interface Tic-Tac-Toe,  <br/>

  -May be ran in your Java compiler of choice, or via CMD with the .jar file  <br/>
  
  -Player 'X' will always go first  <br/>
  
  -Coordinates must be input on seperate lines and x coordinates always go first, for example  <br/>
    1 (enter)  <br/>
    2 (enter)  <br/>
  will result in a X/O being placed in the middle left position  <br/>

  -Coordinate Structure  <br/>
            (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1)  <br/>
            (1,2) | (2,2) | (3,2)  <br/>
            (1,3) | (2,3) | (3,3)  <br/>

  -This is my first mostly complete coding project, I am aware of the following bugs: <br/>
    -Ignores/Skips a player if an integer besides 1,2,3 is input  <br/>
    -Crashes if anything but an integer is input when the game asks for coordinates  <br/>
